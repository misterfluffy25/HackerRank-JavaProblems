Welcome Coders, Here I upload the solutions of Java practice problems as I solve them on HackerRank throughout my journey of learning Core Java Programming. I provide solutions for the help of new coders who are on their way to become a pro coder from rookies, these solutions are for their ease while learning new language. Drop a text for detailed explanation and code related queries. No credits needed just, REMEMBER ME FOR GOOD THAT'S ALL :) 
11 CODING RULES TO SUCCEED - 
1.Trick Your Brain with the 20min Rule
2. Code for a Purpose. Have a project/vision in your mind.
3. There is no “perfect language to learn”. Means if you learn this go on for something else
4. Understand what you’re writing.
5. It’s Ok to Not Know, but its not okay to sit and do nothing.
6. Be a Copycat, if things take too much time find a solution extract the required logic and code by yourself.And remember it later.
7. Be accountable to someone. Show your work - may be the person whom you tag in memes :)
8. Keep Learning.
10. Get a peer - Try Pair Programming. 
11. Get into the Habit of Chunking.
12. Break someone else's code.
